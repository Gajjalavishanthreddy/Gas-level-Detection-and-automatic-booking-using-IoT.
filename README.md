# Gas-level-Detection-and-automatic-booking-using-IoT.
This project aims at automating the booking of LPG cylinders and detecting gas leaks using IoT Technologies
LPG is commonly used for cooking in many nations because to its affordability, convenience, or due to the fact that it is the favoured fuel.
This study focuses on the use of the Internet of Things to gauge and show the amount of petrol in residential LPG cylinders and this aids in automatically scheduling new LPG cylinders and finding gas leaks.
Usually, There is no information on the LPG cylinders' capacity. Consequently, to show the LPG level, the level of Using a load sensor (SEN-10245), LPG is monitored. The sensor's output is connected to Arduino. R3.
The user receives the information through SMS thanks to the GSM Module.
Reservations are made by dialling the designated fuel reservation number. 
The gas leak is then discovered by a gas sensor (MQ-2). 
By using this to detect it, the LCD will display the current LPG level continuously. 
Thanks to IOT and the knowledge of LPG use that is valid from the date of starting, the user is informed by sending a message to their mobile phone when the LPG level is dangerously low (below 20%).
By automatically phoning the gas booking number when a new supply of LPG is required, it is feasible to clear up any confusion between pre-booking and late booking. 
Secondly, by locating the leak, we may prevent LPG gas explosion accidents.
